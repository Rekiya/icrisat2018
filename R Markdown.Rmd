This is my introduction

##Background
This is the background of the study

### Dataset
### creating ordered list
1. data1
1. data2
1. data3


#creating unordered list
+ data1
+ data2
+ data3

# For scientific names in italics and ** for bold italics

*Scientific name*

**Scientific name**




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r explore_data}
data(iris)
head(iris)
```
# Before you include your code, use ```{r if it is r code}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
